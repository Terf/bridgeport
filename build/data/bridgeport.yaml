Name: BRIDGEPORT
Description: BRIDGEPORT is a publicly accessible web portal that provides massive analytic resources and aims to foster crosstalk for brain imaging genomics. BRIDGEPORT allows you to interactively browse the atlas in a 3D view and explore the phenotypic landscape and genetic architecture of the human brain. You can also download the MUSIC atlas and GWAS summary statistics for your downstream analyses. The GWAS summary statistics include P-value, effect size (e.g., beta, odds ratio, etc), allele information, rsID, etc. For the MuSIC atlas, users can download the NIFTI images for their own usage.
